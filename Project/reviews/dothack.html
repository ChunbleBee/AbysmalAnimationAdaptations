					<p>.hack//Beyond The World isn't a terrible movie, but, other than topical elements, lacks what made the rest of the multimedia franchise so endearing. Other than fans of the franchise, I can't really recommend watching the movie, not because it's bad, but rather because your time would be better spent watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//Sign">.hack//SIGN</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//Liminality">.hack//LIMINALITY</a>, as those series explore everything from video game addiction, to depression, to A.I. self-realization. I would recommend picking up a copy of the Blue-Ray release, however, as it comes with the import-only title .hack//VERSUS</p>
